# what-to-watch

Are you ever stuck trying to decide what movie to watch for movie night? What To Watch is a community movie recommendation table, listing
the 25 most recently suggested movies. Users can edit this list by adding their own movie picks, or removing any of the older ones, so 
the list is ever-changing!

Click on the **All movies/edit list** button to customize the list. You can enter your new movie or delete the pre-existing ones by following 
the buttons. This section shows the full history of movies that are in the database, as opposed to just the most recent 25, so you can revise
it accordingly.

Lastly, if you're set on the genre you want to watch, you can filter by genre and get the 25 most recently suggested movies in that genre.
